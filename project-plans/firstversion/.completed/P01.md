# Phase P01 Completion Marker

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20260216-FIRSTVERSION-V1.P01`

## Timestamp
2026-02-16T11:45:00Z

## Decision
**PASS**

## Prerequisites Verified
- P00A marker exists: YES (`.completed/P00A.md`)

## Analysis Artifacts Created/Verified

### Domain Model
- `analysis/domain-model.md` - Core entities, invariants, transition surfaces, replacement map

### Pseudocode Components
- `analysis/pseudocode/component-001.md` - App state event handling
- `analysis/pseudocode/component-002.md` - Runtime orchestration
- `analysis/pseudocode/component-003.md` - Persistence + theme resolution (includes exact path policy)

### Traceability and Compliance Matrices
- `analysis/requirement-phase-traceability-matrix.md` - REQ-* to phase mapping
- `analysis/hybrid-strategy-compliance-matrix.md` - UI reuse vs core rebuild rules
- `analysis/integration-contract-completeness-matrix.md` - Integration touchpoint checklist

### Behavior Contracts
- `analysis/runtime-lifecycle-acceptance-matrix.md` - RT-* acceptance criteria with idempotency scenarios
- `analysis/f12-cross-view-consistency-matrix.md` - F12 semantics across views with canonical checklist
- `analysis/search-help-acceptance-contract.md` - HELP-*/SRCH-* acceptance criteria
- `analysis/crud-validation-error-matrix.md` - CRUD field validation rules

### Persistence and Theme Policy
- `analysis/persistence-matrix.md` - Storage artifacts, exact path policy, integrity/recovery rules
- `analysis/theme-precedence-fallback-policy.md` - THEME-* acceptance criteria, Green Screen fallback

### Alias File
- `analysis/lifecycle-transition-acceptance-matrix.md` - Alias to runtime-lifecycle

## Deferred Implementation Detection
```
grep -RIn "TODO|FIXME|HACK|placeholder|for now|will be implemented" project-plans/firstversion/analysis/
```
Result: Only match is reference to anti-placeholder rule itself, not actual deferred work.

## Structural Verification
- [x] All required analysis artifacts exist
- [x] domain-model.md covers entities, invariants, edge/error model
- [x] Pseudocode components cover app state, runtime, persistence/theme
- [x] Traceability matrix maps all REQ-* to phases
- [x] Hybrid strategy compliance rules are explicit

## Semantic Verification
- [x] Every REQ-FUNC-* and REQ-TECH-* has traceable phase coverage
- [x] Persistence path policy is exact and environment-overridable
- [x] Runtime lifecycle includes idempotency edge cases
- [x] F12 behavior is specified across all view contexts
- [x] Search/help behavior includes result rendering and no-results handling

## Files Created/Modified
- All analysis artifacts were created in prior planning work
- Verified complete and consistent with specification

## Next Phase
P01A - Analysis Verification
