@plan PLAN-20260216-FIRSTVERSION-V1.P01A
@requirement REQ-TECH-006

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20260216-FIRSTVERSION-V1.P01A`

## Timestamp
2026-02-16T11:48:00Z

## Decision
**PASS**

## Prerequisites Verified
- P01 marker exists: YES (`.completed/P01.md`)

## Structural Verification

### P01 marker exists
YES - `.completed/P01.md` created with full artifact listing

### Analysis artifact includes entities, invariants, transitions, errors
YES - `domain-model.md` contains:
- Core entities: Repository, Agent, AgentStatus, RuntimeBinding, ThemeState
- Invariants per entity (unique slug, non-empty name, pass_continue default, etc.)
- Transition and side-effect ownership section
- Edge/error model section

### Requirement references are explicit and correct
YES - `requirement-phase-traceability-matrix.md` contains 20 REQ-* references covering:
- REQ-FUNC-001 through REQ-FUNC-010
- REQ-TECH-001 through REQ-TECH-010

## Semantic Verification

### Analysis supports all functional flows in overview/ui-mockups
YES - Domain model covers:
- Dashboard workspace (Repository, Agent, AppState aggregates)
- CRUD workflows (entity invariants, validation)
- Runtime interaction (RuntimeBinding, AgentStatus)
- Split mode (AppState split-mode fields)
- Lifecycle controls (AgentStatus transitions)
- Search/help (AppState search/help fields)
- Theme behavior (ThemeState, fallback invariants)
- Persistence (settings.toml, state.json payloads with path resolution)

### Analysis aligns with technical-overview boundaries
YES - Domain model explicitly maps:
- Domain/Data model layer
- App state + event layer
- Runtime orchestration boundary
- Theme boundary
- Persistence boundary

### No unresolved contradiction remains
YES - Hybrid replacement map section explicitly encodes what to reuse vs rebuild.

## Deferred Implementation Detection
```
grep -RIn "TODO|FIXME|HACK|placeholder|for now|will be implemented" project-plans/firstversion/analysis/domain-model.md
```
Result: No matches (exit code 1 = no matches found)

## Verification Outputs
- domain-model.md: clean, complete
- requirement-phase-traceability-matrix.md: 20 REQ-* references
- All analysis artifacts: structurally and semantically verified

## Next Phase
P02 - Pseudocode
