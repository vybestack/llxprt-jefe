## Phase ID
`PLAN-20260216-FIRSTVERSION-V1.P05A`

## Timestamp

## Decision
**PASS**

## Prerequisites Verified
- P05 marker exists: YES (`.completed/P05.md`)

## Structural Verification

### P05 marker exists
YES

### All RED tests now GREEN
YES - 36 tests pass, including all 14 that were failing

### Implementation follows pseudocode
YES - `AppState::apply` implements component-001 lines 13-33

## Semantic Verification

### State transitions are deterministic
YES - Same event + state always produces same result

### No side effects in apply
YES - apply is pure function (mut self -> Self)

### Boundaries respected
YES - State layer doesn't call runtime/persistence/theme directly

## Verification Outputs

### cargo fmt --all --check
Exit code: 0

### cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
Exit code: 0 (after refactoring for clippy satisfaction)

### cargo test --all-features
```
running 36 tests
test result: ok. 36 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored
