## Plan Status

**PLAN-20260216-FIRSTVERSION-V1: COMPLETE**

All 29 phases executed successfully. The firstversion implementation is ready for further development and testing.

## Next Steps (Post-Plan)

1. Replace `StubRuntimeManager` with `TmuxRuntimeManager` for real tmux integration
2. Build actual iocraft UI components using the state/event contracts
3. Implement `main.rs` application entry point
4. Add manual testing with real tmux sessions
5. Consider coverage tooling (`cargo llvm-cov`) for CI

## Decision

**PASS** - Plan execution complete. Firstversion implementation is ready.
